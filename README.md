## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `tkinter`, `ttkbootstrap`, `customtkinter`, `pycryptodome`

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/encryption-decryption-tool.git
   cd encryption-decryption-tool
   ```

2. **Install the required packages:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application:**
   - Run the application using `python main.py`.
   - The main window will open, displaying tabs for different encryption algorithms.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - Navigate through the tabs to choose between Caesar Cipher, AES, and RSA.

3. **Encrypt/Decrypt Text:**
   - Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted in the provided input box.
   - For AES, enter a 16-byte key.
   - Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the desired operation.
   - The output will be displayed in the output box.

4. **Generate RSA Keys:**
