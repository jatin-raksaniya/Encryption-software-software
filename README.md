## Features

- **Caesar Cipher:** Simple text encryption and decryption using a shift-based substitution cipher.
- **AES (Advanced Encryption Standard):** Secure encryption and decryption using a symmetric key algorithm.
- **RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman):** Public-key encryption and decryption with the ability to generate RSA key pairs.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy-to-use graphical interface for encryption and decryption tasks.
- **About the Project:** Information about the project and its contributors.

## Download-error

### Download Error: False Positive Alert

If you encounter a "virus detected" error, rest assured, this is a false positive. The issue arises because I used PyInstaller to create the .exe file, which can trigger antivirus software warnings due to the file packing process. The encryption and decryption tool (entool) is entirely safe to use, and this warning can be safely ignored.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Windows operating system
- The provided `entool.exe` file

### Steps

1. **Download the executable:**
   - Download the `entool.exe` file from the [releases](https://github.com/jatin-raksaniya/Encryption-tool/releases/tag/entoolv1.0.0.0) page.

2. **Run the executable:**
   - Double-click the `entool.exe` file to launch the application.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application:**
   - Run the executable file by double-clicking on `entool.exe`.
   - The main window will open, displaying tabs for different encryption algorithms.

2. **Select an Algorithm:**
   - Navigate through the tabs to choose between Caesar Cipher, AES, and RSA.

3. **Encrypt/Decrypt Text:**
   - Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted in the provided input box.
   - For AES, enter a 16-byte key.
   - Click the "Encrypt" or "Decrypt" button to perform the desired operation.
   - The output will be displayed in the output box.

4. **Generate RSA Keys:**
   - In the RSA tab, click the "Generate Keys" button to generate a new pair of RSA keys.

5. **About the Project:**
   - Access the "Information of Project" menu to read about the project and its contributors.
